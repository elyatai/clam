# clam

a shellfish-themed discord bot

## how to use

I can't recommend you do, but all the dependencies should be in one of
`stack.yaml`, `package.yaml`, `default.nix`. you'll need Nix. clambot's meant to
be run on one guild only, so guild-specific yet global configuration options are
intentional.

## where to find it

my instance of clambot lives on a semi-private server - if you know me and want
to join, I'm happy to send you an invite

## etymology

the bot runs on the [calamity][https://hackage.haskell.org/package/calamity]
framework, which kinda sounds like "clam"
